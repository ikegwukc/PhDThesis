%Accurate star-galaxy classification has many important applications in modern precision cosmology. However, a vast number of faint sources that are detected in the current and next-generation ground-based surveys may be challenged by poor star-galaxy classification. Thus, we explore a variety of machine learning approaches to improve star-galaxy classification in ground-based photometric surveys. In Chapter~\ref{chapter2}, we present a meta-classification framework that combines existing star-galaxy classifiers, and demonstrate that our Bayesian combination technique improves the overall performance over any individual classification method. In Chapter~\ref{chapter3}, we show that a deep learning algorithm called convolutional neural networks is able to produce accurate and well-calibrated classifications by learning directly from the pixel values of photometric images. In Chapter~\ref{chapter4}, we study another deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks in a semi-supervised setting, and demonstrate that our semi-supervised method produces competitive classifications using only a small amount of labeled examples.
